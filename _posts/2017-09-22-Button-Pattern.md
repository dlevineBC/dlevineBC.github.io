This pattern explains how to help users work out if they can or should use your service by asking them a series of questions.

User Story: As a user I need to confirm that I meet a requirement so that I can access a service.

Government View: Government enables citizens to verify that they are eligible to receive a service and access its benefits.

## Why use this pattern

Using ‘Check Eligibility’ can lower your operating costs by reducing the time and effort that support teams spend explaining your service.

Services also spend time and effort processing applications from users who don’t need, aren’t eligible or aren’t ready to use a service.

## When to use this pattern

Use 'Check Eligbility' as one of the first steps in your service.

You should help people find out whether your service is right for them as soon as you can. Doing this means they won’t waste time trying to use it if they’re not eligible or don’t need it.

## How to use this pattern

When using this pattern, you need to:

1. Ask a series of simple questions.

2. Automatically work out what a user needs to know.

3. Present the user with a ‘results’ if they are eligible for the service.

If the user is not eligible for the service based on their responses, provide clear direction on next steps or alternate ways to access the service if they are available.
