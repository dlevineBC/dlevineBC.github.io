Design patterns are repeatable solutions to common design problems. Patterns are not templates. They can be used in different applications, and may look different, but the core solution remains the same.

### Value of service design patterns
1. Establish a common language for service design and delivery.
2. Provide a service design toolset for service providers and designers.
3. Help enable a more consistent service experience across government programs.
4. Create common ways of measuring different patterns.
5. Can be used to map new or existing services — just like a set of building blocks can be used to create new alternatives or structures.
6. Document best practices, research and resources associated to a pattern.
